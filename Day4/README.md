# Operators
They are Special symbols which are used to perform some predefined operations on operands (variable, contants, etc. i.e a value).

## Category
1. Unary Operators : Required only one operands
2. Binary Operators : Required two operands
3. Ternary Operators : Required three operands

## Types of Operator 
- Arithmetic Operators 
- Assignment Operators
- Composite / Compound / Shorthand Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators (||, &&)
- Bitwise Operators (&, ^, |)
- Conditional Operators (? :)
- Increment & Decrement Operators
- MISC Operators


### Arithmetic Operators
- Addition :
    
        a + b
- Subtraction :

        a - b
- Multiplication : 

        a * b
- Division : 

        a / b
- Modulus : 

        a % b
- Exponentiation : 

        a ^ b
- Power : 

        **
- Floor Division : 

        a // b

Category : Binary

Precedence : Left to Right

Priority : 

        Brackets ()
        Exponentiation / Power (**, ^)
        Multiplication, Division and Modulus (*, /, %)
        Addition and Subtraction (+, -)


### Assignment Operator
It is used to assign value of RHS operand to LHS operand.

Example

        let a = 10


### Composite / Compound / Shorthand Operators
These operators are used to perform multiple operations in a single line.

        a = a + b       =>      a += b
        a = a - b       =>      a -= b
        a = a * b       =>      a *= b
        a = a / b       =>      a /= b
        a = a % b       =>      a %= b
        a = a ^ b       =>      a ^= b
        a = a ** b      =>      a **= b

### Relational Operators
It is used to compare two values.

        <       : Less Than
        >       : Greater Than
        <=      : Less Than or Equal To
        >=      : Greater Than or Equal To
        ==      : Equal To
        !=      : Not Equal To (Check Only Value)
        ===     : Strict Equal To / Identical (Check Value and Data Type)
        !==     : Strict Not Equal To / (Check Value and Data Type)
