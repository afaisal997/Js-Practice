Javascript is one of the most popular programming language in the world right now.
It is used for both front-end and back-end development.
It is used for creating interactive web pages, web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and server

It is a widely-used language, with a large community of developers and a vast number of libraries and
frameworks available.   
It is a language that is constantly evolving, with new features and updates being added regularly.


### What Can you do with it ?
You can do a lot of things with JavaScript, here are a few examples:
- **Front-end Development**: You can use JavaScript to create interactive web pages, web applications, and
mobile applications.
- **Back-end Development**: You can use JavaScript to create server-side applications, RESTful APIs,
microservices, and more.
- **Desktop Applications**: You can use JavaScript to create desktop applications using frameworks
like Electron.
- **Game Development**: You can use JavaScript to create games using frameworks like Phaser.
- **Machine Learning**: You can use JavaScript to create machine learning models using libraries like
TensorFlow.js.
- **Data Analysis**: You can use JavaScript to create data visualizations and perform data analysis
using libraries like D3.js.
- **Automation**: You can use JavaScript to automate tasks using Node.js.
- **Server-side Programming**: You can use JavaScript to create server-side applications using
frameworks like Express.js.
- **Database Management**: You can use JavaScript to interact with databases using libraries like
Sequelize.
- **Testing**: You can use JavaScript to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end
tests using frameworks like Jest.
- **Security**: You can use JavaScript to create secure web applications using libraries like
Helmet.

- **Web Performance Optimization**: You can use JavaScript to optimize web page performance
using libraries like Lighthouse.
- **Accessibility**: You can use JavaScript to make web applications more accessible using
libraries like A11y.js.
- **Progressive Web Apps**: You can use JavaScript to create progressive web apps using
frameworks like PWA.js.

### Where Does JavaScript Run ? 
Orignally Designed  to run only in browser, therefore every browser has a javascript engine built in it.
But now with the help of Node.js, it can run on the server side as well.
It can run on any device that has a JavaScript engine, including:
- **Web Browsers**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and more.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the
server-side.
