# String

A JavaScript String is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. In JavaScript there is no character type (Similar to Python and different from C, C++ and Java), so a single character string is used when we need a character. Like Java and Python, strings in JavaScript are immutable.

It is enclosed in single or double quotes.

Strings are immutable since once a string is created it will receieve a reference in the memory and its value will never change.

Indexing of string start from 0.
