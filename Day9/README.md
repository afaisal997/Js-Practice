# While Loop

While loop is used when we does not have a fixed number of iterations
OR
While loop is used to repeat a part of the program multiple times. if the number of iterations is not fixed then it is recommanded to use while loop.

### Syntax

        Initialization;
        while(condition){
            -------------------------------
            -------------------------------
            // code to be executed
            -------------------------------
            -------------------------------
            Update Expression;
        }

# Do-While Loop:

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the condition at the
end of the loop instead of the beginning. This means that the code inside the loop
will always be executed at least once.

### Syntax

        Initialization;
        do{
            -------------------------------
            -------------------------------
            Number of Statements
            -------------------------------
            -------------------------------
            update expression;
        }
        while(condition)
